Here are the key performance metrics for streaming applications like Philo or Netflix, ordered by importance:

1. **Startup Time / Time to First Frame**
   - Time taken from pressing play to when the first video frame appears
   - Critical for user experience and engagement
   - Industry standard is under 2-3 seconds

2. **Buffer Ratio / Rebuffering Rate**
   - Percentage of time spent buffering vs. total playback time
   - Directly impacts user experience
   - Target is typically <1% buffer ratio

3. **Video Quality / Bitrate**
   - Average video quality delivered to users
   - Quality switches during playback
   - Resolution consistency
   - Target depends on network conditions but aims for highest sustainable quality

4. **Error Rate**
   - Playback failures
   - Stream initialization failures
   - Platform crashes
   - Target is <1% error rate

5. **Latency**
   - Time delay between live event and viewer playback
   - End-to-end delivery time
   - Especially critical for live streaming
   - Target varies but typically 2-10 seconds for live content

6. **Concurrent Viewers**
   - Number of simultaneous streams
   - System scalability measure
   - Infrastructure performance indicator

7. **CDN Performance**
   - Content delivery network response time
   - Geographic distribution efficiency
   - Cache hit ratio

8. **Network Bandwidth Utilization**
   - Data transfer efficiency
   - Adaptive bitrate performance
   - Network cost optimization

9. **User Engagement Metrics**
   - Watch time
   - Drop-off rates
   - Return user rate
   - Content completion rate

10. **Device Compatibility**
    - Performance across different devices
    - OS versions
    - Browser types
    - App versions

11. **Resource Utilization**
    - CPU usage
    - Memory consumption
    - Battery impact on mobile devices

These metrics are typically monitored in real-time through analytics dashboards and are used to:
- Identify and resolve issues quickly
- Optimize streaming quality
- Improve user experience
- Make infrastructure decisions
- Guide development priorities

Yes, separating performance metrics tests from UI/functional tests can be beneficial for several reasons:

### Benefits of Separation

1. **Clarity and Focus**:
   - **Performance Tests**: These tests focus on measuring metrics like response time, throughput, and resource usage. Keeping them separate allows for a clearer understanding of performance-related issues.
   - **UI/Functional Tests**: These tests validate the functionality and user interface of the application. They ensure that the application behaves as expected from a user's perspective.

2. **Different Testing Strategies**:
   - Performance testing often requires different tools, frameworks, and strategies compared to UI/functional testing. For example, you might use tools like JMeter, Gatling, or LoadRunner for performance testing, while using Selenium, Cypress, or Appium for UI testing.

3. **Resource Management**:
   - Performance tests can be resource-intensive and may require specific environments or configurations (e.g., load testing environments). Keeping them separate allows for better resource allocation and management.

4. **Reporting and Analysis**:
   - Having separate test suites allows for more focused reporting and analysis. You can easily track performance metrics independently from functional test results, making it easier to identify performance bottlenecks.

5. **Execution Timing**:
   - Performance tests may need to be run at different times (e.g., during load testing phases) compared to functional tests, which are often run continuously during development.

### Suggested Structure

You might consider organizing your tests in a way that clearly separates performance metrics from UI/functional tests. For example:

```
/tests
├── /performance
│   ├── performanceMetrics.test.ts
│   └── loadTests.test.ts
└── /ui
    ├── login.test.ts
    ├── navigation.test.ts
    └── playback.test.ts
```

### Conclusion

Separating performance metrics tests from UI/functional tests can lead to a more organized, efficient, and effective testing strategy. It allows teams to focus on specific areas of the application, manage resources better, and produce clearer reports.
